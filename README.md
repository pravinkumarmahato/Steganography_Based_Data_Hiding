# Steganography_Based_Data_Hiding
Information security plays a major role in any data transfer. One way to restrict direct access and ensure more security can be obtained by information hiding that focuses on hiding the existence of secret messages. Steganography is a data-hiding technique that allows users to conceal messages, images, and other types of data within other forms of data. It is a way of communicating securely by hiding data in plain sight. By concealing data within other types of data, it can be protected from outside detection. This makes it much more difficult to detect and exploit than traditional cryptography. In the following study, we combine steganography, a data hiding technique along with a data encryption algorithm in order to achieve more efficiency in securing access to confidential data.
